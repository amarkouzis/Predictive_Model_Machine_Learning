# Predictive_Model_Machine_Learning

### Summary of the problem and the approach chosen
___
This project aims to forecast the APPLE stock price at different time intervals. It is worth noting that forecasting has always been an issue in many fields: a call centre every week requires forecasts of call volumes, a weather forecast, a decision on whether to build another power station in the next five years requires forecasts of future demand, the management of a portfolio of equity investments requires forecasts of stock requirements.

For the implementation of the project was used a data set from the Kaggle. The programming language used is Python in the Jupyter Notebook environment. More specifically, an attempt was made to construct a prediction model based on a Long short-term memory (LSTM), which LSTM is an artificial neural network.
